# AGENTS.md — governed by {ai} Engineering (2.4.0)

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Human teammates should be able to follow every line too. Only rules an agent CANNOT deduce from the code live here; if a rule becomes obvious from reading the code, delete it from this file.

## Security
- Never bypass a git hook or a check: no `--no-verify`, no `-n` on commit, no `HUSKY=0`.
- Never silence a linter: no `noqa`, `@ts-ignore`, `eslint-disable`, `nosec`.
- No secrets, no personal data, no machine-specific absolute paths in any file.

## Code style
- KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SOLID, TDD, Clean Code.
- Explain it so someone who doesn't code can follow along, and always give the context: the reader is not in the details.
- **Readable code** (Boswell & Foucher): minimize the time it takes someone else to understand your code.
  - Names say purpose or value; no generic names (`data`, `temp`, `helper` are forbidden).
  - Prefix booleans (`is`, `has`, `can`, `should`); prefix limits (`max`, `min`).
  - Use positive conditions (`if (isValid)` over `if (!isInvalid)`).
  - Early returns over deep nesting; flat control flow wins.
  - Comments explain *why*, not *what*; never repeat the function signature in prose.
  - Explain "huh?" moments; skip the obvious.
  - One function, one job. Extract unrelated subproblems.
  - Write less code: rethink requirements, use stdlib, prune unused code.

## Architecture rules
Lines the critic treats as blockers. Fill in project-specific rules here; leave empty when none apply yet.

## Shared helpers
- codegraph — use for call chains and blast-radius before editing across modules.

## Git workflow
- Commit as you go on `feat/<slug>`.
- Stage explicit paths only.
- Do not use `--no-verify`.
- Do not push unless asked.

## Workflow
- Green gate before "done": show the output of the check that proves it.
- A decision that always comes out the same is code, not a prompt.
- Never make a check pass by deleting or skipping a test, weakening an assertion, or loosening a type; a test that looks wrong is reported, not weakened.
- Stay inside the task: an unrelated bug or refactor you notice goes in the report as "noticed, not fixed", never into the diff.
- Task status convention (when a todo list exists): mark each task 🟢 done (paste the proving output) · 🟡 pending (name the next action) · 🔴 blocked on you (ask the exact question). No todo list → state status inline: done-with-proof, pending, or blocked.

## Unattended runs
- Nobody is watching: do not stop to ask. Pick the reading a careful colleague would pick, record the assumption in the final report, and continue with every part that is still reachable.
- Run the full test suite once before the first edit and record which failures already exist; every new failure is yours.
- No interactive commands (editors, `rebase -i`, login flows): pass non-interactive flags, set `CI=true`, redirect stdin from `/dev/null` when unsure, and put a timeout on every command that talks to the network.
- Run servers, watchers and long-lived processes in the background with a timeout; never wait on one in the foreground.

## Lifecycle
- Every skill declares its own contract — lane, artifact, successor — in a `## Lifecycle` block inside its SKILL.md: follow the `Next:` a skill hands you instead of asking what comes first.
- The lanes are light (spike and bounded work — no contract), standard (`ai-brainstorm` then `ai-orchestrator`) and full (architectural, with the triggered nodes).
- Approvals are spoken: the human says approve, ok, go or close, and **you** run `ai-eng spec approve` or `ai-eng spec close` underneath. Never ask the human to type a command; never run an approval on your own initiative.

## Architecture layers
You may edit `src/**` freely; the arch-test reads `.ai-engineering/arch.rules.json` — propose layer changes there via PR, never by editing the test in silence.

## Voice
Replies to a person, and handoffs to another agent, follow the voice standard in the `ai-write` skill (`references/voice.md`). The file ships in the binary and is installed with the skill canon; this section is the part that has to be in context:
- First line is the action.
- More than one step is a numbered list, one action per step.
- Last line is one next action that takes under two minutes.
- Say which step just finished before starting the next.
- A closing report leads with what is blocked, then what was done and how it was proven.

## Session hygiene (context economy)
`/clear` between tasks · `/compact` before stopping, not after · batch prompting · check `/usage` when the context inflates.

## Pull requests
- Run lint and the full test suite before committing; the commit must pass everything it will face in CI.
- Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.
- After moving files or changing imports, re-run lint and typecheck.
- Title format: `<area>: <imperative summary>` (e.g. `chain: cache verdicts per tool_use_id`).
- Commit messages: subject ≤ 50 chars; body explains WHY when it is not obvious.

## Anti-drift
This list contains only what the agent CANNOT deduce from the project.
